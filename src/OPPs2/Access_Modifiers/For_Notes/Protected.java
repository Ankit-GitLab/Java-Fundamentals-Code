/**
 * protected
 *    - Same package ke andar access ho sakta hai.
 *    - Dusre package ke subclass mein bhi access ho sakta hai.
 *    - Inheritance ke liye useful hai.
 *
 * üß† Key Concepts of protected:
 * Same Package: A protected member (variable or method) is accessible from any
 * class in the same package, including the subclass.
 *
 * Different Package: A protected member can only be accessed by a subclass
 * (not directly).
 *
 * Inheritance: The primary use of protected is to allow access to members of
 * a parent class from its subclass, even if they are in different packages.
